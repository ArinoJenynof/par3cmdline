
 I write some updated points in Parity Volume Set Specification 3.0.
This is a reminder for later implementation.


##### UNIX Permissions Packet

 I changed the default value for i_mode.
By doing this change, all non used values are same 0xff bytes.
It's easy to see which value is set or not.

*Table: UNIX Permissions Packet Unset Values

| Field | Unset Value |
|------:|------------:|
| atime, ctime, mtime | 2^64-1 (maximum unsigned value) |
| UID, GID | 2^32-1 (maximum unsigned value) |
| i_mode | 0xffff | invalid value to indicate unset
| owner name, group name | empty string | 
| xattr | empty list |


##### FAT Permissions Packet

 I changed the default value for FileAttributes.
By doing this change, all non used values are same 0xff bytes.
It's easy to see which value is set or not.

*Table: FAT Permissions Packet Unset Values

| Field | Unset Value |
|------:|------------:|
| CreationTimestamp, LastAccessTimestamp, LastWriteTimestamp |  2^64-1 (maximum unsigned value)  |
| FileAttributes | 0xffff | invalid value to indicate unset


##### FFT Matrix Packet

 I made this packet for test.
This will be changed later.

The FFT matrix packet has a type value of "PAR FFT\0" (ASCII). The packet's body contains the following:

*Table: FFT Packet Body Contents*

| Length (bytes) | Type | Description |
|---------------:|:-----|:------------|
| 8 | unsigned int | Index of first input block |
| 8 | unsigned int | Index of last input block plus 1 |
| 1 | unsigned int | max number of recovery blocks (as power of 2) |
