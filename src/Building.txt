BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

With Microsoft Visual Studio: use the solution file (par3cmdline.sln).

Alternatively, use CMake as described below.


BUILDING ON LINUX
=================

To build using CMake:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
% cmake --build build     # or:  make -C build

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is one of: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel.

To install:

% cmake --install build   # installs under /usr/local by default


To debug the build itself:

% make -C build VERBOSE=1

...will show individual commands being executed. Alternatively:

% cmake -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON ...

...will enable verbose builds by default.


To build with Ninja instead of Make, which can be faster:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -B build-ninja
% cmake --build build-ninja     # or:  ninja -C build-ninja


To cross-compile from Linux to Windows, creating a Windows executable:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake -B build-windows
% cmake --build build-windows
