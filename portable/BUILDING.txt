Building using CMake on Linux:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
% make -C build

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is one of: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel.


To make a debug build:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build
% make -C build


To debug the build itself:

% make -C build VERBOSE=1

...will show individual commands being executed. Alternatively:

% cmake -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON ...

...will enable verbose builds by default.


To build with Ninja instead of Make (which is faster):

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja -B ninja-build
% ninja -C ninja-build


To cross-compile from Linux to Windows:

% cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake -B build-windows
% make -C build-windows
